# Twilio setup for OpenDialer

Everything below happens in the [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com).
Budget 15 minutes. You need a Twilio account with a payment method for
anything beyond calling your own verified numbers.

## 1. Account credentials

Console home → **Account Info**.

- Copy **Account SID** → `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
- Copy **Auth Token** → `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`

## 2. Buy a voice-capable number

**Phone Numbers → Manage → Buy a number.** Tick **Voice**. Buy:

- one **US** number (required)
- one number per European country you call, for local presence (optional;
  most EU countries require address and identity documents, which Twilio
  collects under **Regulatory Compliance** before the purchase completes)

Open **/numbers** in the app and click **Sync from Twilio**: every voice
number you own becomes a selectable caller ID, and the first one is the
default when no number matches the lead's country. To pin a specific default,
set `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` (E.164, `+14155550100`).

## 3. API key (for browser calling)

**Account → API keys & tokens → Create API key.** Type *Standard*.

- **SID** → `TWILIO_API_KEY_SID`
- **Secret** → `TWILIO_API_KEY_SECRET` (shown once)

## 4. TwiML App (for browser calling)

**Voice → Manage → TwiML apps → Create new TwiML App.**

- Friendly name: `OpenDialer`
- **Voice Configuration → Request URL**: `https://<your-app-host>/api/twilio/voice`, method **POST**
- Leave Messaging empty. Save.
- Copy the **SID** (starts with `AP`) → `TWILIO_TWIML_APP_SID`

The app's **/settings** page prints the exact request URL for your deployment.
Status and recording callbacks are set by the app on every call, so nothing
else needs configuring in the console.

## 5. Geographic permissions

**Voice → Settings → Geo permissions.** Enable every country you will call.
Twilio blocks most non-US destinations by default; the app surfaces this as
"Calling this destination is disabled on your Twilio account".

## 6. Environment variables

Set these in Clawnify under **Settings → Environment Variables** (or in
`.dev.vars` locally), then deploy:

```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=+14155550100   # optional
TWILIO_TWIML_APP_SID=
TWILIO_API_KEY_SID=
TWILIO_API_KEY_SECRET=
```

If the Twilio Account SID and Auth Token are already saved under
**Settings → API Keys → Twilio**, they are injected automatically and only the
remaining four need to be added as environment variables.

Without the last three the app still works in **fallback mode**: it calls the
phone number you save under **/settings**, then bridges you to the lead.

## 7. Trial accounts: upgrade first

The current Twilio trial program strips `<Dial><Number>` and the recording
attributes from TwiML and replaces them with a spoken "not available on trial
accounts" message. That is exactly the TwiML this app returns, so on a trial
account the browser connects, hears that message, and no lead is ever dialed.
The fallback mode bridges the same way and is blocked too.

Upgrade the account (add a payment method) before testing. The only thing a
trial can exercise is number sync on **/numbers**.

## 8. Ireland region (optional)

For EU data residency set `TWILIO_REGION=ie1` and redo steps 1, 3 and 4 inside the Ireland region of the console. The region is part of the URL, and the page badge reads "Ireland (IE1) Region":

- IE1 Auth Token and API key: `https://console.twilio.com/ie1/account/keys-credentials/api-keys` (the Auth Tokens section on that page is the IE1 token, distinct from the US1 one).
- IE1 TwiML App: `https://console.twilio.com/ie1/develop/voice/manage/twiml-apps`, same voice URL as step 4.

Then set each number's voice region to Ireland (Phone Numbers → the number → Voice configuration). Mixing a US1 key with `ie1`, or the US1 Auth Token with the IE1 API host, fails with "The Twilio token was rejected" or a 401 from Twilio.

After changing any of these in Clawnify, redeploy: the values are injected at deploy time, and the first request or two after a deploy can still be answered by the previous version.

## 9. Check it

1. Open **/settings**: both badges should be green.
2. Open **/numbers** → **Sync from Twilio**: your numbers appear.
3. Add yourself as a lead, open **/dialer?lead=…**, click **Call**, allow the
   microphone, and answer your phone.
