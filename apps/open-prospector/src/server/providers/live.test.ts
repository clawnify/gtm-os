// The rest of the suite stubs fetch, because response *mapping* is what can be
// tested without a paid key at fourteen vendors. But mapping is not the only
// thing that breaks. The other half is the **invocation contract** — the host,
// the path, the API version, the auth header name — and that half is invisible
// to a stubbed test: a stub happily answers an adapter pointed at a v6 endpoint
// that was retired, or sending a header the vendor has never heard of.
//
// So this calls every adapter against the real vendor with a deliberately
// invalid key. It costs nothing (no credit is spent on a rejected request) and
// it asserts the one thing that proves the request was well-formed: the vendor
// got far enough to reject the *key*. A wrong path or version answers 404, a
// wrong parameter shape answers 400, and either way the outcome is not
// `unconfigured` and this fails.
//
// It is gated rather than deleted because it has already earned its place: it
// caught Tomba answering a bad key with HTTP 400 and an `errors.type` body
// instead of a 401, which the shared status mapping reported as a broken
// vendor rather than a rejected key.
//
// Not part of CI: it depends on fourteen third-party APIs being up, and a test
// that fails for someone else's outage stops being read.
