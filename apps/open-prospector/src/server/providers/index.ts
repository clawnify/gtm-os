// The runner owns everything that is not a vendor HTTP call: ordering, key
// resolution, eligibility, the local cache, and the cost ledger. Adapters stay
// dumb request/response wrappers, so adding a vendor is one file plus one line
// in REGISTRY.
//
// House rule, matching what buyers actually want from a waterfall: the first
// *verified* result wins. An unverified value is held as a fallback but does
// not stop the search, so we never hand back an address we could not validate.
