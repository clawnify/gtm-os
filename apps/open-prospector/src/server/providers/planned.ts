// waterfall runner cannot call one even by accident: it resolves ids against
// REGISTRY, and a planned vendor simply isn't there.
//
// They are surfaced in the UI (badged "Planned") because the roadmap is real
// product information — it tells a user what a future key will buy them, and
// shows the intended waterfall depth per field. The badge is what keeps that
// honest: an unlabelled entry would imply a capability we have not shipped.

/**
 * Vendors we researched, could not adapt, and the structural reason why.
 *
 * All but one share a single blocker, and it is worth naming once: **their
 * enrichment API does not answer in the same request.** You POST, you get an
 * id, and the result arrives later by webhook or by polling. The waterfall
 * runner is synchronous by necessity — it decides whether to spend a credit at
 * the next vendor based on whether this one resolved the field, so it cannot
 * proceed without an answer in-band.
 *
 * Supporting any of them is therefore not an adapter, it is a second execution
 * path: a pending-enrichment table, a public callback route with its own token,
 * and out-of-band lead and ledger writes. That is one deferred feature that
 * would unlock this whole list at once, which is exactly why they are recorded
 * together rather than each half-built.
